2. Sign-up page: input username section, input password section
3. Change password page: verification section, new password input section, new password verification section

### Log in interface
1. When a user enters their credentials it gets redirected to main website after verification at the back-end.
2. sign-up button redirects user to  sign-up page
3. chage password button redirects user to change password page.

    

### Sign-up button 
1. It takes username as input
2. it takes password as input
3. at the backend it saves the info by linking them to each other
4. it should save the info at the same location where log-in system can access it and check it for later use.

# Log-in module 

## Targets
  1. To take "id" and "verification" method as inputs.
  2. Match them in database, if they match redirect to next page else show  wrong log-in credentials text on the same page.
  3. Have a "regsiter new user" page where new user can regsiter themself.
  4. Have a password change system, that helps user change the password linked to their "id" 

### Log-in page 
  1. "id" input section
  2. Password input section
  3. if id and password match, log-in successful
  4. if id is in the database but password is not, wrong password; option to re-enter password or change password
  5. if id is not in the data base; wrong id and suggest to sign-up intstead with option to re-enter id.
